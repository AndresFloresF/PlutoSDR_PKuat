Q?: How do I link to the cp210xmanufacturing library?

A?: The library is installed (by default) in /usr/local/lib. Therefore you can add 
	these two flags to your compiler command:
		-L/usr/local/lib -lcp210xmanufacturing

		This will link your executable with the cp210xmanufacturing library
		and will allow g++ to find the library.

Q?: Why is my device not recognized when calling CP210x_GetNumDevices()?

A?: It could be a permissions problem. Try running your program as root. 
	If the device is recognized when your program is run as root but not when
	run with normal permissions, the SiliconLabs.rules file may not be 
	installed properly.

	root should always have read/write permissions to USB device files.

	To automatically grant global read/write permissions to all USB devices with the
	Silicon Labs Vendor ID (0x10c4), copy the SiliconLabs.rules file to
	/etc/udev/rules.d/:

	$ sudo cp SiliconLabs.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

	Refer to SiliconLabs.rules for more information. Also it may be necessary to
	create your own udev rules file by modifying SiliconLabs.rules to include
	your own Vendor ID and optionally Product ID.

	A8:3 The udev rules file may not have been applied. udev should monitor the
	/etc/udev/rules.d/ directory for new rules file, but this does not always work.
	You may need to unplug/replug your device and possibly reboot for the udev
	rule to take affect.

Q1: Why does the 


Q?: Why do I get the following error when trying to build libcp210xmanufacturing?

Package libusb-1.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.

A2: The libslabhidtouart library requires libusb-1.0-0.dev to be installed.
This will copy the libusb-1.0 library and include files and register the
package with pkg-config.

On Ubuntu, install libusb-1.0-0-dev:
$ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev


Q3: Why do I get the following error when trying to build libcp210xmanufacturing?

g++: not found

A3: The libslabhidtouart library requires gcc, g++, and ld to compile and build
the library.

On Ubuntu, install g++:
$ sudo apt-get install g++

- or -

To install a g++ package with support for 32-bit and 64-bit builds:
$ sudo apt-get install g++-multilib


A12: Use the file command to display the binary format

$ file libslabhidtouart.so.1.0


Q13: I've done everything here and I still can't build using make

A13: Sometimes you might need to rebuild the project after installing new
header files and libraries or to rebuild object files.

$ make clean
$ make
